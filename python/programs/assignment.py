#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
#some of the various examples of Assignment operators are:
'''
Basic Assignment operator '=': assigns the value the variable 'x=5'.

Addition Assignment operator '+=': adds the number to the existing variable 'x+=5' is same as 'x+5'.

Subtraction Assignment operator '-=': subtracts the number from the existing varaible 'x-=5' is same as 'x-5'.

Multiplication Assignment operator '*=': multiplies the number to the existing variable 'x*=5' is same as 'x*5'.

Division Assignment operator '/=':divides the variable by the given number 'x/=5' is same as 'x/5'.

Modulus Assignment operator '%=': It calculates the remainder when the variable is divided by the number 'x%=5' is same as 'x%5'.

exponentiation Assignment operator '**=' It is used to raise the variable to the power of the given number 'x**=5' is same as 'x**5'.

floor Division Assignment operator '//=' divides the variable with the given number and rounds the value to nearest integer returning the largest integer less than or equal to the result 'x//=5' is same as 'x//5'.

#Example program

x = 10 #basic assignment operator.

x+=5 #Addition assignment operator.
print(x)

y = 10
y-=5 #Subtraction assignment operator.
print(y)

z = 10
z*=5 #multipication assignment operator.
print(z)

a = 10
a/=5 #division assignment operator.
print(a)

b = 10
b%=5 #modulus assignment operator.
print(b)

c = 10
c**=5 #exponentiation assignment operator.
print(c)

d = 10
d//=5 #floor division assignment operator.
print(d)
